# Home DotFiles Configuration

## Home Manager Template dotfiles
This part of the repo was originally based off the home manager template.

It allows you to run home manager totally out of the repo and it doesn't exist
on the rest of the system.

## Usage
WARNING: Do not install on your own system. This repo will not work without 
secrets. I have left most of the repo visable though so you can see how
my files are setup and use them for inspiration.

### Apply
Simply run the apply.sh script under the wil account and it will apply all the 
user settings.

### Update
You can run the update.sh to update home manager which will in turn update all
packages. Then you can run apply again to get the latest version installed.
