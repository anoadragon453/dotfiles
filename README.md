# Wil's nix configuration and dot files.
Feel free to make use of whatever you want on here and use it as inspiration to create your own

## Warnings
Do not apply these settings on your own system, they are incomplete. I have put them up here for 
inspiration on creating your own setup.

## Restructuring in progress
I am currently condensing this down to a single set of config for my systems before I migrate over to
using flakes.
