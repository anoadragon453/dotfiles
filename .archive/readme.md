# Dotfiles
Here are my personal dotfiles which i deploy whenever I setup a new machine. 
Feel free to copy and use anything you want from it.

This is a constant work in progress so if you deploy it to your own machine 
don't be suprised if it just randomy breaks. The idea is you should get inspiration 
to create your own configuration not just blindly apply mine.

# How they work
These files are designed to be deployed using GNU/Stow which lets you apply a "package" onto your home directory. Each 
folder in this repository is a package.

# License

In other words, do what you want with it. The only requirement with the MIT License is that the license and copyright notice must be provided with the software.
